            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Oſt Reverend Father in God, there is no one thing in this world that of men truely zealous and Chriſtian, in theſe latter dayes of the world with greater earneſtneſſe hath bin deſired, then that by a joynt and common conſent of all the Churches rightly, and according to the Canons of the ſacred Scriptures, reformed, there might be a draught made, and divulged, containing, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing the ſum, and ſubſtance of that Religion, which they doe both concordably teach, and uniformely maintaine.</p>
            <p>That holy man (of happy remembrance) D. <hi>Cranmer</hi> (who ſometime enjoyed that roome in our Church,<note place="margin">Arch. Cran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.</note> which your Grace now worthily poſſeſſeth) in the dayes of that moſt godly yong Prince, K. <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixt, employed a great part of his time and ſtudy, for the effecting of that work; and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
<pb facs="tcp:23945:3"/>
his thoughts with the moſt principall perſons, and of rareſt note in thoſe dayes for their wiſedome, piety, and cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit among the people of God throughout Chriſtendome. M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Calvin,</hi> underſtanding of his intent, addreſſed his letters unto the ſaid Archbiſhop, and offred his ſervice, ſaying, That might his labours ſtand the Church in ſtead, <hi>Ne decem quidem maria,</hi> it would not grieve him to ſaile over ten Seas to ſuch a purpoſe.</p>
            <p>But this proving a worke of much difficulty, if not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether impoſſible in mens eyes, eſpecially in thoſe dayes, to be brought about;<note place="margin">Vnity of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine in all Churches re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.</note> the next courſe, and reſolution was, that every Kingdome, and free State, or Principality, which had abandoned the ſuperſtitions, and Antichriſtian Religion of the Church of Rome, and embraced the Goſpell of Chriſt, ſhould divulge a Briefe of that Religion, which among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves was taught, and beleeved, and whereby through the mercy of God in Chriſt, they did hope to be ſaved. Which to Gods great glory, and the ſingular benefit, and comfort of all Churches, both preſent, and to come (as the extant Harmony of all their confeſſions doth moſt ſweetly record) with no great labour was notably performed.</p>
            <p>This worke of theirs told the Churches in thoſe dayes, and doth us, and will informe our poſterity; that not only in every particular State, and Kingdom, but alſo throughout Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,<note place="margin">Ab initio re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formationis ardebant amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re veritatis omnes Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ci, Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ci, Plebeii: Jezler. de diu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur. belli Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>char. pag. 49.

For the multitudes of them that did beleeve (I ſpeake both joyntly of all, and ſeverally of each reformed people, not of every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular perſon, fantaſtique, falſe apoſtles, and perverſe teachers, or profeſſors in any Church, who were not wanting even in the Apoſtles dayes) touching the maine, and fundamentall points of true Religion, were then of one heart, and of one ſoule, and did think, and ſpeake one thing, and live in peace.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The ſaid Archbiſhop (for unto whom better, after God, and the King, can we aſcribe the glory of this worthy Act?) wrought this Vnity, &amp; Vniformity of doctrine in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, in the Halcyon dayes of our Engliſh <hi>Ioſias,</hi> K. <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixt of that name: and the ſame doctrine, ſo by his meanes

            <p>A certain learned man,<note place="margin">

So eſteemed he (and with him many thouſands of learned, and judicious men) of the doctrine then ratified by authority, and profeſſed in this Kingdome.</p>
            <p>But thoſe dayes of our Churches peace continued not long (through our unthankfulneſſe,<note place="margin">Q. <hi>Mary.</hi>
               </note> and ſinnes) neither on the other ſide was our perſecution permanent (through the goodneſſe of God) though for the time exceeding vehement, and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent.

And their prayers were not made in vaine: For both Queene <hi>Mary</hi> lived not long; and Lady <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizabeth</hi> was placed in the Royall throne; ſuperſtition was expulſed, and true Religion againe, to the ſingular comfort, and multiplication of Gods people in this Kingdome, very ſolemnely reſtored.</p>

            <p>They build not Presbyteries expreſſedly (though under hand, if it be well marked, they doe erect them in their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes of the Sabbath:) but they ſet up a new Idol, their Saint
<pb facs="tcp:23945:10"/>
Sabbath (earſt in the dayes of Popiſh blindneſſe S. Sunday) in the midſt, and minds of Gods people.</p>
            <p>By the former they haue opened not a gap, but a wide gate vnto all licentiouſneſſe, liberty, &amp; prophaneneſſe on the Holy dayes (which is readily, and greedily apprehended of all ſorts of people euery where, eſpecially of their fauorites) to the high diſhonour of God, decay of our deuotion, hinderance of Chriſtian knowledge and wiſdome in all ſorts, eſpecially in the vulgar multitude, and poore ſeruants, aduantage of the common enemies, and groſſe contempt of the neceſſary, and laudable orders of our Church. By the latter they haue intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced a new, and more then either Iewiſh, or Popiſh ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion into the land, to no ſmall blemiſh of our Chriſtian pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, and ſcandall of the true ſeruants of God, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with doctrine moſt erroneous, dangerous, and Antichriſtian.<note place="margin">The ſumme of the Sabbath doctrine broa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched by the Brethren.</note>

            <p n="22">22. Their doctrine ſummarily may be reduced vnto theſe two heads, whereof the one is, that the Lords day (euen as the old Sabbath was of the Iewes) muſt neceſſarily be kept, and ſolemnized of all and euery Chriſtian, vnder the paine of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall condemnation both of body, and ſoule.</p>
            <p>The other, that vnder the ſame penalty it muſt be kept from the higheſt to the loweſt, both of King, and people, in ſort and manner as theſe Brethren among themſelues haue deuiſed, decreed, and preſcribed.</p>
            <p>The former of theſe is like that of the falſe apoſtles which came from <hi>Iudea</hi> vnto <hi>Antioch,</hi> and taught the Brethren, that vnleſſe they were circumciſed after the manner of <hi>Moſes,</hi> they could not be ſaved.

            <p>The latter, as bad as that, hath bin the mother of many he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticall aſſertions, and horrible concluſions.</p>
            <p>I haue read (and many there be aliue which will iuſtifie it) how it was preached in a Market towne in Oxfordſhire, that to doe any ſeruile worke, or buſineſſe on the Lords day, is as great a ſinne, as to kill a man, or to commit adultery. It was
<pb facs="tcp:23945:11"/>
preached in Somerſet-ſhire, that to throw a bowle on the Sabbath day, is as great a ſinne, as to kill a man. It was prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched in Norfolke, that to make a Feaſt, or wedding dinner on the Lords day, is as great a ſin, as for a Father to take a knife and cut his childs throate. It was preached in Suffolke (I can name the man, and I was preſent when he was convented be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Ordinary for preaching the ſame) that to ring more Bels then one upon the Lords day to call the people unto Church, is as great a ſinne as to commit murder.</p>
            <p>When theſe things I read, and heard, mine heart was ſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with an horror, and ſo is it ſtill, when I doe but think of them, and calling into mind the Sabbath doctrine, at Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don Printed for <hi>I.

And they may ſubſcribe (as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hath beene noted) vnto ſuch of them, as containe the ſumme of Chriſtian Faith, &amp; the doctrine of the Sacraments. But vnto the ſame Articles, for number 36. agreed vpon in this Conuocation at London, <hi>an.</hi> 62. they neither wil, nor dare nor may ſubſcribe. For neither the reſt of the Articles in that booke, nor the Booke of common prayer, may be allowed, no though a man ſhould be depriued from his miniſtery for it (ſay the ſaid brethren in a certaine Claſſicall decree of theirs.) The late Polititian is not afraid to mooue the high, and moſt honorable Court of Parliament, that Impropriation may bee let to Ferme vnto incumbent miniſters, viz. which faithfully preach in the Churches the true doctrine of the Goſpell, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Articles of Religion, concerning faith and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments: meaning that ſuch Miniſters as preach the ſame do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, if they proceed to the reſt of the Articles, concerning
<pb facs="tcp:23945:14"/>
either Conformitie in externall, and ceremoniall matters; or Vniformitie in other points of doctrine contained in that booke, ſhould not be partakers of that benefit, or of Benefices Impropriate.</p>
               <p n="31">31. If it be demanded, what the cauſes may be,<note place="margin">Why the Br. will ſubſcrib vnto ſome, but not vnto all the Articles.</note> why they will vnto ſome, but will not vnto all; or why they will vnto thoſe Articles which concerne Faith and the Sacraments, but will not vnto the reſt ſubſcribe? The reaſons thereof be two, whereof</p>
               <p>The one is, for that in their opinion, there is no Law to compell them to ſubſcribe vnto all: For (ſay the Brethren re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiant I know not where,) Wee have alwayes beene ready to ſubſcribe to the Articles of Religion concerning the doctrine of Faith, and of the Sacraments, which is all that is required by Law. Alſo the Brethren in Deuonſhire, and Cornewall: We are ready (ſay they) to ſubſcribe to the third (which concerneth the Booke of Articles of Religion) ſo farre as wee are bound by Statute concerning the ſame, <hi>viz.</hi> as they concerne the doctrin of the Sacraments, and the confeſſion of the true faith. And the 22. London Brethren tell King <hi>Iames</hi> to his head, how the Subſcription which he calleth for is more then the Law requireth.</p>
               <p>Their other reaſon is, becauſe (as the Lincolnſhire doe ſay) ſundry (as the London Brethren affirme) many things in that booke be not agreeable, but contrary to Gods Word.</p>
               <p n="32">32. If theſe things be true which they doe alleadge, ſurely then are thoſe men to be chronicled for the Faithfull, the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and innocent Brethren indeed, whom neither preſent Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefices can allure; nor the angry countenance, and diſpleaſure of a King, even of the puiſſant, &amp; powerful King of great Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, can force to doe anything at his becke, and pleaſure, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther againſt Law, or for which there is no law, and who had rather to forgoe all their earthly commodities &amp; liuings, yea and to goe from their charges, and miniſtery, and to expoſe themſelues, their wiues and children, to the miſeries of this world (grieuous for our fleſh and blood to endure,) then to approue any thing fob true, &amp; ſound by their hands, which is
<pb facs="tcp:23945:15"/>
oppoſite, or not agreeable to the reuealed will, and Scriptures of God.</p>
               <p>But if theſe allegations of theirs be but weake, and ſinfull ſurmiſes, or rather apparantly moſt falſe, ſcandalous, and ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous imputations to their Prince, their mother Church, and this State, then doubtleſſe, as they euen Chriſtians now liuing cannot but take them: ſo ages to come will euerlaſtingly note, and cenſure them both for diſloyall Subiects that ſo tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a truly, and moſt Chriſtianly religious King, ill deſeruing children, that ſo abuſe their honorable, and reuerand Fathers, and ſuperiours of State, and authority; turbulent ſpirits, not peaceable men, which raiſe ſuch broiles, troubles, and diuiſions in the Church and Kingdome (the iſſues whereof no tongue can foretell, and are fearefull being thought of) without cauſe and finally neither faithfull, nor godly Preachers, but vngodly broachers of vntruthes, and ſlanders, and the very authors and fautors of horrible confuſion, and faction in Gods Church, whoſe peace they ſhould ſeeke, and promote euen with their deareſt blood.</p>
               <p n="33">33. Since the Statute for Vniformity in rites and doctrine was firſt enacted, moe then 35. yeeres haue paſſed, in all which ſpace, neither the Brethren now being, nor the Brethren afore them liuing, haue hitherto ſhewne, of the 39. Articles, for names and titles: Which, for number, How many the Articles be which Eccleſiaſticall Miniſters neceſſarily muſt, how many which they may not, or need not, vnleſſe they liſt, ſubſcribe vnto (which I am ſure they, or ſome of them, at one time, or other would have expreſſed) had the Law fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red there recuſancy, and they bin able to have juſtified their Maxime, which is. That they are not compellable by ſubſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to approoue them all. Againe, ſince the firſt eſtabliſhment of that Statute Law, the moſt reuerend Fathers, and truly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Miniſters of this Church (ſound for iudgement, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found, for learning, zealous for affection; ſincere, for religion, faithfull, in their Churches: painefull, in their charges: more profitable many wayes: of as tender conſciences euery way, as any of theſe Brethren combined) according both to their
<pb facs="tcp:23945:15"/>
bounden duties, and (as they are perſwaded) to the very pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, and true intent of the ſaid Statute, have alwayes both with their mouthes acknowledged, and with their pennes ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued the 39. Articles of our religion for truthes not to be doubted of, and godly.</p>
               <p>Yea, and the Brethren too themſelues (which now ſo ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulouſly, when they are orderly called thereunto, doe hold backe their hands, and will ſubſcribe but choiſely vnto ſome of them) euen they with their mouthes (which is equiualent, and all one) have, &amp; that according to the Statute (or elſe their liuings be void) vpon the firſt entrance into all, and ſingular their eccleſiaſticall benefices, openly both read, and teſtified their conſent vnto the ſaid Articles, for number euen nine and thirty, acknowledging them, I ſay, all of them to be agreeable to Gods word: whereof the people in their ſeuerall charges be ready witneſſes to teſtifie ſo much before God and the world.</p>
               <p n="34">34. Againe, of theſe Brethren (that will ſubſcribe but vnto which they pleaſe of theſe Articles) there be ſome who faine would beate into mens heads, if they could tell how to make it credible) that the Doctrine of our Church is altred from that it was in the raigne of Q. <hi>Eli.</hi> But this aſſertion being too groſſe, egregiouſly vntrue,<note place="margin">A late deuice of the Br. to ſhunne ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription.</note> &amp; no waies iuſtifiable they ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly give out, and report (ſo induſtrious be they to inuent new ſhifts to cloak their inueterate, and rooted pertinacy) how the purpoſe, if not doctrine of our Church is of late altered from that it was. And therefore though they can be well content to allow of the old doctrine, and ancient intention: yet vnto the old doctrine, and new Intention of our Church, they cannot ſubſcribe, might they either gaine much, or loſe whatſoeuer they have thereby. Beſides, this new Intendement, contrary to the old purpoſe, if not doctrin of our Church, is become now the maine, and principall obſtacle why they cannot ſubſcribe vnto the booke of Common prayer, and booke of Ordination, as earſt they (ſome of them) foure times have done, when aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well Intention, as Doctrine of our Church, was pure &amp; holy,</p>
               <p>Laſtly, they ſeeme not obſcurely to intimate vnto the State that were they ſure, or might be aſſured, that the purpoſe of
<pb facs="tcp:23945:16"/>
our Church were the ſame which it was, neither varied from the doctrine; they would be preſt, and as ready, euen foure, if not forty times moe, to ſubſcribe vnto the forementioned bookes of Common prayer, and of ordination, as aforetimes they did, when they were out of doubt the Intention of our Church was correſpondent to her Doctrine, that it was found and good. I haue foure times ſubſcribed (ſaith a Brother) to the booke of Common prayer with limitation, and reference of all things therein contained (not vnto the purpoſe onely, or doctrine onely,) but unto the purpoſe, and doctrine of the Church of England. Yet cannot the ſame man with a good conſcience ſo much as once more ſubſcribe (which formerly, and that with a good conſcience had ſubſcribed foure times.) His reaſon is, Becauſe the purpoſe, if not doctrine of our Church, (to which he referred his ſubſcription) appeareth to him, by the late Canons, booke of conference, and ſome ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of men in great place, and others, to be varied ſomewhat from that which he before (not without reaſon) took it to be.</p>
               <p n="35">
                  <note place="margin">The purpoſe, and Doctrine of our Church continue the ſame.</note>35. The purpoſe of our Church is beſt knowne by the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine which ſhe doth profeſſe, the Doctrine by the 39. Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles eſtabliſhed by Act of Parliament; the Articles by the words, whereby they are expreſſed; and other purpoſe then the publike Doctrine doth miniſter, and other Doctrine then in the ſaid Articles is contained, our Church neither hath, nor holdeth; and other ſenſe they cannot yeeld, then their words doe impart. The words be the ſame, and none other, then earſt, and firſt they were. And therefore the ſenſe the ſame; the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles the ſame; the Doctrine the ſame; and the purpoſe, and Intention of our Church ſtill one, and the ſame.</p>
               <p>If then the purpoſe be knowne by her Doctrine, and Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles; and the true ſenſe by their very words: needs muſt the purppoſe of our Church be the ſame, becauſe her Doctrine, and Articles for number, words, ſyllables, and letters, and every way be the very ſame.</p>
               <p>And ſo our Churches intention in her publike Doctrine, and Articles reuealed, being good at the firſt, it is ſo ſtill. For her purpoſe (continuing one and the ſame) cannot be ill at the
<pb facs="tcp:23945:16"/>
laſt, which was good (and ſo beleeued, and acknowledged, even by the Brothers ſubſcription) at the firſt; or good in good Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and ill, in illuſtrious King <hi>Iames</hi> his dayes.</p>
               <p n="36">36. If the premiſſes ſufficiently explane not the conſtancy of our Churches purpoſe in profeſſing religion ſincerely,<note place="margin">Neither the Doctrine, nor purpoſe of our Church alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</note> then caſt we our eyes vpon the Propoſitions, which ſhe publikely maintaineth; and if we find them the ſame which euer they have beene, then need we not doubt (the Brethren them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves being Iudges) but the Articles againe, their ſence, the Doctrine, purpoſe, and Intention nf the Church of England (the Propoſition interpreting as it were, the ſaid Articles) is the very ſame it ever was.</p>
               <p>Now that Propoſitions (pregnantly, and rightly gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and ariſing from the articles) be the ſame, &amp; for ſubſtance vnaltered (though vpon good conſiderations, ſome few bee added to the former) and all of them approued for true, and Chriſtian, by the lawful, &amp; publike allowance of our Church, the Booke here enſuing plainely will declare, and ſo demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate withall not the Doctrine onely, but intention alſo of our Church, to be the ſame, and not changed: and being vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed, the books then of common prayer, and of ordination too, conſidered in the purpoſe and intention of the Church of England, and reduced to the Propoſitions (as the Brethren would haue them) be well allowed, and authentically appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued; and the ſaid brethren with as good conſcience now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, and afreſh may ſubſcribe vnto all the Articles, euen concerning the Booke of common prayer, and of ordination, aſwell as of the kings ſupremacy, and of Religion, as afore, often, and alwayes they did.</p>
               <p n="37">37. For my ſelfe (moſt reuerend Father in God) what my thoughts be of the religion in this Realme at this inſtant pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed, and of all theſe Articles, if the premiſſes doe not, that which here followeth will ſufficiently demonſtrate. Twenty, yea 22 yeeres agoe, voluntarily of mine owne accord, &amp; alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether vnconſtrained, I publiſhed my ſubſcription vnto them, my Faith is not either ſhaken, or altred, but what it then was,

it ſtill is: yeeres have made thoſe haires of mine gray, which were not; and time, much reading, and experience in Theolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicall conflicts and combates, have bettred a great deale, but not altered one whit my judgement, I thanke God.</p>
               <p>Nothing have I denied, nothing gaine-ſaid, which afore I deliuered.</p>
               <p>The Propoſitions are (and yet not many) moe; the method altered, quotations added, both, for the ſatisfaction of ſome learned, and iudicious friends of mine, requeſting it at mine hands, and for the benefit both of the common, and vnlearned, and of the ſtudious and learned Reader.</p>
               <p>The whole worke expreſſeth aſwell my deteſtation, and renunciation of all aduerſaries &amp; errors, oppoſite, croſſing, or contradicting the doctrine profeſſed by vs, and protected by our King, or any Article, or particle of truth of our Religion; as my approbation of that truth which in our Church by wholeſome Statutes and Ordinances, is confirmed.</p>
               <p>There is not an heretike or Schiſmatike (to ſpeake of) of any ſpeciall marke, that from the Apoſtles time hitherto, hath diſcouered himſelfe, &amp; his opinions vulgarly in writing, or in print againſt our doctrine, but this hereſie, fancy, or phrenſie may be here ſeene againſt one propoſition or other.

                     <p>Neither about the Tormentors there, who are thought of ſome, to be holy Angels<note n="l" place="margin">Albertus, &amp; Roffenſis.</note>, of others, to be very devils<note n="m" place="margin">S. Th. Morc.</note>.</p>
                     <p>Neither about the torments.

                     <p>Neither about the cauſes of Purgatory torments: becauſe that ſome doe thinke that onely veniall ſinnes<note n="o" place="margin">Greg. dial. l. 4. c. 39.

                     <p>Nor about the time, which they that be tormented, ſhall abide in Purgatory. For ſome have given out, how the poore ſoules there be continually in torments, till the day of Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as <hi>Dionyſ. Carthuſianus</hi>

                     <p>Nor finally about the ſtate of ſoules in Purgatory. For,</p>
                     <p>Our Engliſh Papiſts at Rhemes doe thinke the ſoules in Purgatory to be in a more happy, and bleſſed condition, then any men that live in this world<note n="t" place="margin">Teſt.

                        <hi>Thomas Aquinas</hi> holdeth how the paines of hell fire, and of Purgatory are all one, &amp; nothing differ, but that the one is but temporall, and the other not ſo. And others, put in choyce either to tarry in Purgatory one day, or to endure the miſeries of this world an 100 yeares, have choſen to ſuffer the troubles of this life an hundred yeares together, rather then to abide the paines of Purgatory but one ſhort Winters day<note n="x" place="margin">Cap. Quid, in aliud. diſt. 25.</note>.</p>
                     <p>Therefore in this contrarietie of opinions, ſome of them, the Papiſts themſelves cannot deny, muſt be; we ſay all of them are fond, and contrary to the Word of God.</p>
                     <p>Beſides, they nouriſh moſt curſed and damnable errors, as</p>
                     <p>That all the ſoules of the faithfull, ſeparated from their bodies, are not at reſt.</p>
                     <p>That all ſins in their owne nature, be not mortall, or dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and that ſome deſerve not everlaſting torments. They are purged in Purgatory.</p>
                     <p>That one ſinfull man may ſave, and ſatisfie the wrath of God for another; and that eaſily by prayer, ſaying, or doing ſomething for them.</p>
                     <p>That if friends in this world will doe nothing for the poore ſoules in Purgatory paines; yet may the ſaid ſoules come at length unto happineſſe, by abiding their deſerved torments untill the laſt houre, or day of judgement, in Purgatory.</p>
                     <p>Finally, that the Pope is God, in that he can at his pleaſure diſcharge guiltie ſouls both from the guilt of ſinne, and from the puniſhments due for the ſame.</p>

The Prieſt (ſay they) bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the perſon of God, and is the lawfull iudge over the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent; and may both abſolve from the guilt of ſinne, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict a puniſhment: according to the offence.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, the miniſter, who ordinarily is the Curate of every pariſh; but extraordinarily, and in the time of great necſſitie, or by licence, is any Prieſt. And yet ſome ſinnes are ſo grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous, as none may abſolve but either the Biſhop, or his Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiary, as the crime of Inceſt, breaking of vowes, Church-robbing, Hereſie, adultery: and ſome againe none remit, or pardon, but the Pope onely, or his Legate, as burning of Churches: violent ſtriking a Prieſt; counterfeiting of the Popes Bulles, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, and laſt of all, the effect. Hereby, they ſay, the penitent ſinner is purged, abſolved, &amp; made as cleane from all ſinne, as when he was newly baptized, and beſides, enriched
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:23945:97"/>
with ſpirituall gift, and graces.</p>
                     <p>The conſideration hereof hath mooved, beſides the Church of England, all other Churches reformed, to ſhew their dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation of this new Sacrament, as having no warrant from Gods Word<note n="a" place="margin">Conf.

                     <p>The blaſphemies are outragious, and the errors many, and monſtrous, compriſed in this doctrine of Popiſh penance. For neither can the matter of this their Sacrament, nor the forme, nor the miniſter, nor the effect be drawne from the Word of God.</p>
                     <p>They ſay penance is a ſacrament, and yet can they ſhew no element it hath to make it a ſacrament.</p>
                     <p>Their Contrition is againſt the truth: For no man is, or can be ſufficiently contrite for his ſinnes.</p>
                     <p>To confeſſe all ſinnes, and that one after another, with all circumſtances, unto a Prieſt, as it is impoſſible: ſo it is never enjoyned by God, nor hath ever beene practiſed by any of Gods Saints.</p>
                     <p>That any man in any meaſure, can ſatisfie for his ſinnes, it is blaſphemy to ſay, and againſt the merits of Chriſt.<note place="margin">Teſt. Rhem. in Coloſ. 1.26.</note> And yet doe the Papiſts teach it, as alſo that one man may ſatisfie for another.</p>
                     <p>An untruth is it, that any Prieſt, Biſhop, or Pope, hath pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er at his will to forgive ſinnes; or can enjoyne any puniſhment that can make an amends unto God for the leaſt offence.</p>
                     <p>If penance purge men, and make them cleane from all ſin, then is there a time, and that very often in this life, when men in this life be perfect; which tendeth greatly to the error of the Catharans, Donatiſts, and Pelagians.</p>
                     <p>The doctrine of the Papiſts, that ſuch perſons as willingly depart out of this world without their Shrift are damned, is damnable doctrine, and to be eſchewed: and yet it is diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed every where in their bookes<note n="*" place="margin">Vaux catec. c. 4.

                     <p>The Churches of England, and of other places reformed, doe acknowledge an order of making miniſters in the Church of God, where all things are to be done by order. But that Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der is a Sacrament, none but diſordered Papiſts will ſay: and yet they obſerve none order in ſpeaking of the ſame. For a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them,</p>

                     <p>The ſuperior is the order of Subdeacons, Deacons, and of Prieſts. The Subdeacons are to reade the Epiſtle or Service time, to prepare neceſſaries for miniſtration; and to aſſiſt the Prieſt in miniſtration. The Deacons duty is to reade the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and alſo to aſſiſt the Prieſt in miniſtration. The Prieſt his part, and office is, to miniſter Sacraments, that is to ſay, Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, Penance, the Euchariſt, and to ſacrifice for the quicke and the dead, Anoiling of the ſicke, and Matrimony.</p>
